<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this section about me. </p>

<section>
  <p>My name is <strong>César Alejandro Rivera Guzmán</strong>, a proud <strong>Mexican</strong> and 
  <strong>entrepreneur</strong> with a background as an <strong>Industrial and Systems Engineer</strong>. 
  Proudly <strong>EXATEC</strong> from <strong>Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Puebla</strong>, 
  <br>I combine my technical knowledge 
  with creativity, innovation, and discipline to bring ideas to life.</p>
  
  <p>From an early age, I have been passionate about <em>understanding and improving processes</em>. 
  <br>I believe that <strong>technology, strategic thinking, and adaptability</strong> are key to transforming challenges into opportunities .</p>
  
  <p>My academic journey has led me to work in different areas such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📊 Data analysis and metaheuristics models</li>
    <li>🏭 Electronic manufacturing and process optimization</li>
    <li>💻 Software development and web applications</li>
    <li>📈 Interactive dashboards and decision-making tools</li>
    <li>🌍 Social impact projects, such as anti-corruption campaigns in Mexico</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I also follow a <strong>fitness and wellness lifestyle</strong>, deeply inspired by <em>stoic philosophy</em>. 
  This mindset helps me stay focused, resilient, and consistent both in my personal life and professional projects. 
  I believe in <strong>continuous growth</strong> and building habits that lead to long-term impact.</p>
